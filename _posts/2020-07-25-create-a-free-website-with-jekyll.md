It’s not always clear why we need need a personal website. But here’s the truth: we are a product (a brand) with unique skills to offer to prospective employees and customers. A website is an effective medium to let the world know who we are, what we are capable of, and what our values are. 

I need a website to:

Showcase my projects,
Blog about programming and my other interests, and
Share information about me that would be of interest to a recruiter, including my resume, email, and links to my Github, Medium, and LinkedIn pages.

Being able to easily generate and publish blog posts is another extremely beneficial, but not required featured.

One day I watched a talk on YouTube by a content management system (CMS) evangelist. He discussed the benefits of using a CMS to generate a website composed of content from markdown and text files. This promotes separation of content from code and better security and speed at which content is delivered. Some CMS are either git-backed or talk to an API.


I researched different options for static site generators. My criteria are:

Speed - This includes speed of development (getting a website up and running quickly), and the performance of the website at delivering content.
Popularity - A very important but often overlooked aspect of choosing a technology is how many people use it. When a technology is popular, you’d be able to get more community support (e.g. StackOverflow, tutorials, sample projects) and the creators of the tools have an incentive to continue to support and improve upon their product.
Customization - This is a fringe criterion. Style and uniqueness of the website are not super important for me. I want my website to be a place to share information about me and having too unique of a website could make it more difficult for visitors of the website to find information. Still, it’d be nice if I have the option to choose from different layouts for my website and some customization like fonts.

Jekyll: Built with Ruby and uses Liquid templates. Very popular, created by the founder of Github, and offers free hosting on Github.
